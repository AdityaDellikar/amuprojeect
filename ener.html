            Energy consumption is essential for economic development, but there are wide disparities between developed and developing nations. With increased speed of development in the developing nations energy needs are also increasing. The very original form of energy technology probably was the fire, which produced heat and the early man used it for cooking and heating purposes.<BR>
            
             <b>ENERGY SCENARIO</b>
            Energy is a key input in economic growth and there is a close link between the availability of energy and the future growth of a nation. In India, energy is consumed in a variety of forms such as fuel wood, animal waste and agricultural residues, which are gradually being replaced by commercial fuels. Of the total energy produced in the form of power or electricity, 69% is from coal, 25% is from hydel power, 4% is from diesel and gas, 2% is from nuclear power, and less than 1% from non-conventional sources. Despite the increase in power generating capacity, there is still a 30% deficit of 2,000 million units. Policy makers are formulating an energy policy to ensure adequate energy supply at a minimum cost, achieving self-sufficiency in energy supplies and protecting environment from adverse impact of utilizing energy resources in an injudicious manner.</p>

        <p class="margin-top-10"><b> RENEWABLE Resources</b>
            Renewable resources are resources that can be replenished through rapid natural cycles, such as plants, animals, wood and wood-products, pulp products, natural rubber, fibers, leather, water and soil, and solar energy. In addition to these resources, water and soil are also classified as renewable resources. Solar energy although having a finite life, as a special case, is considered as a renewable resource in as much as solar stocks is inexhaustible on the human scale..</p>

        <p class="margin-top-10"><b>ON-RENEWABLE RESOURCES</b>
            The resources that cannot be replenished through natural processes are known as non-renewable resources.
            These are available in limited amounts, which cannot be increased. These resources include fossil fuels (petrol, coal etc.), nuclear energy sources (e.g. uranium, thorium, etc). metals (iron, copper, gold, silver, lead, zinc etc.), minerals and salts (carbonates, phosphates, nitrates etc.).
            Once a non-renewable resource is consumed, it is gone forever. Then we have to find a substitute for it or do without it.
            Non-renewable resources can further be divided into two categories, viz. Recyclable and non-recyclable<BR>
            <B>RECYCLABLE RESOURCES</B>
            
            These are non-renewable resources, which can be collected after they are used and can be recycled. These are mainly the non-energy mineral resources, which occur in the earth’s crust (e.g. ores of aluminium, copper, mercury etc.) and deposits of fertilizer nutrients (e.g. phosphate sock and potassium and minerals used in their natural state (asbestos, clay, mica etc.)<BR>
            
            <b>NON-RECYCLABLE RESOURCES</b>
            
            These are non-renewable resources, which cannot be recycled in any way. Examples of these are fossil fuels and nuclear energy sources (e.g. uranium, etc) which provide 90 per cent of our energy requirements.</p>

        <h2>WIND ENERGY</h2>

      <div class="block">
        <p><span class="first-character atw">U</span><b>SE OF ALTERNATIVE ENERGY RESOURCES</b>

            There is a need to develop renewable energy sources which are available and could be utilized (solar or wind) or the sources which could be created and utilized (bio-mass). The main renewable energy sources for India are solar, wind, hydel, waste and bio-mass. Bio-mass are resources which are agriculture related like wood, bagasse, cow dung, seeds, etc.<BR>
            
            <B>HYDEL ENERGY</B>
            
            India has a total hydro energy potential of about 1.5 lakh MW, of which only about 20 % is installed. Small hydro plant potential is about 15000 MW and most of it is in the northern and eastern hilly regions.<BR>
            
            <B>WIND ENERGY</B>
            
            The wind power potential of India is about 45,000 MW out of which capacity of 8748 MW has been installed in India till 2008. India is one of the leading countries in generating the power through wind energy.
            Gujarat, AP, Karnataka, MP and Rajasthan are states having more than 5000 MW potential each. These potentials could be improved if the technology of putting turbines in sea is embraced. There are wind farms on sea generating as high as 160 MW of power.<BR>
            
            <B>GEOTHERMAL ENERGY</B>
            
            Geothermal energy is thermal energy generated and stored in the Earth, originating from the original formation of the planet and from radioactive decay of minerals. It is cost effective, reliable, sustainable, and environmentally friendly, but has historically been limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries. Recent technological advances have expanded the range and size of viable resources, opening a potential for widespread exploitation. Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases, but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels. This has the potential to help mitigate global warming if widely deployed.<BR>
            
            <B>OCEAN THERMAL ENERGY CONVERSION(OTEC)</B>
            
            Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) uses the difference between cooler deep and warmer shallow or surface ocean waters to run a heat engine and produce useful work, usually in the form of electricity. OTEC has the potential to offer global amounts of energy that are 10-100 times greater than other ocean energy options.<BR>
            
            <B>BIOMASS ENERGY</B>
            
            Biomass is the oldest means of energy used by humans, used for heat and light. It is a mixture of 65% methane (CH4) and 35% CO2 and may have small amounts of hydrogen sulphide (H2S), moisture and siloxanes. It can be converted by anaerobic digestion or fermentation into a gaseous fuel called biogas, which can be used as a fuel in any country for any heating purpose, such as cooking, or in anaerobic digesters to convert energy into electricity and heat. It can also be compressed, much like natural gas, and used to power motor vehicles.<BR>
            <B>BIO-FUELS</B>
            
            India has more than 50 million hectare of wasteland, which could be utilized for cultivating fuel plants. Jatropha is one of the options which can be planted on arid lands and be used for production of bio fuels.<BR>
            
            <B>SOLAR ENERGY</B>
            
            India being a tropical country has potential to use solar energy on commercial bases. According to estimates, 35 MW of power could be generated from one sq km. With such potential, solar energy has bright future as energy source for the development of the country. Initial cost is the biggest limitation which has led to the low realization of its potential. For solar energy to become one of the front runners, it will require lot of research, cheap technology and low capital.</p>

        <p class="margin-top-10"><B>PROBLEMS RELATED TO THE USE OF ENERGY RESOURSES</B>

            <B>FOSSIL FUELS</B>
            
            • Global warming
            • Acid rains
            • Dangers posed by leaded fuels ,Oil spills
            • Water pollution caused by poorly managed coal mines
            • Air pollution.<BR>
            
            <B>ALTERNATE ENERGY RESOURSES</B>
            
            • The initial cost of establishment of alternate energy generation is costlier than conventional resources.
            • Maintenance of these structures is difficult.
            • It requires more space.
            • Energy supply is unpredictable during natural calamities.<BR>
            
            <B>CASE STUDY</B>
            
            Importance of the energy resources in present economy and as a base for our future can be underlined by the fact that recent confrontations between some powerful nations of the world have primarily been attributed driven by objective to secure their energy supplies. Examples of this have been the two gulf wars. It was the hunger for energy resources that drove Iraq to lead an offensive over Kuwait and also reason for second Gulf war has been attributed to energy security by defense experts. In recent times, world has witnessed a confrontation at South China Sea between India, Vietnam and China over the issue of exploring natural gas and petroleum under the sea bed.</p>
