            The need for water for crops varies from crop to crop, and research stations are busy identifying the water needs of all the crops. To keep the topsoil moist, scientific methods of ploughing are developed. To maintain the water storage for breeding fish and prawn culture, special structures are provided adjacent to the weirs to maintain low velocities. The different purposes of multipurpose projects have their conflicting affect on the environment, but the planning has to proceed in such a way that the impact on environment is kept to be minimum while serving the urgent and primary needs of the people.<BR>
            
             <b>Groundwater and aquifers</b>
             Groundwater and Aquifers are reservoirs of water that have been trapped in the earth's crust for centuries, and can be drawn by digging wells and pumping water from them</p>

        <p class="margin-top-10"><b>Groundwater and wells</b>
            Groundwater and Wells are used to bring groundwater to the land surface by means of pumps, such as deep wells and shallow wells. Tube wells are used to lift water to the surface of the ground, reducing water losses and environmental degradation.</p>

        <p class="margin-top-10"><b>LOODS AND DROUGHTS</b><BR>
            <B>FLOODS:</B>

            Floods are caused by various factors, such as climate, land-use practices, and failure of dams and other control works. They can be mitigated by structural, water control, and non-structural measures. Structural methods include dams, reservoirs, and retarding basins, channel management and embankments, while water control methods include flood proofing and catchment modifications. Non-structural methods include drainage and flood protection, flood forecasting, flood warning and emergency preparedness systems, flood insurance, public information and education, and flood relief.<BR>
            <B>DROUGHTS:</B>
            
            Drought is the most serious physical hazard to agriculture in the world, leading to serious economic consequences and human misery. Shortage of water for basic needs is the main problem, while getting sufficient drinking water is another. Advance techniques such as Cloud Seeding and Artificial Rains are being tried, but are expensive and unpredictable. Government has found reasonable remedies in the form of development of small watersheds.<BR>
            
            <b>DAMS: BENEFITS AND PROBLEMS</b>
            
            Dams are the major structures in any reservoir from the point of view of structural importance, design details and cost. Depending on the material used for construction, dams can be masonry dams, concrete dams, earthen dams, rock fill dams, steel dams and timber dams. They are also known as overflow dams and non-overflow dams. Water resources projects are constructed to several purposes depending on the needs of people of the area to be served, such as irrigation and agriculture, hydropower generation, drinking water supply, water for Industries, flood control, navigation, recreation and amusement parks and afforestation. The next priority is the Hydropower development, as the natural resources for other forms of energy such as thermal are becoming scarce. To address the scarcity of drinking water, the emphasis is on bringing water to the cities from storage reservoirs. In the flood plains, the problem of inundation of adjacent habituated areas is a priority, and transportation by navigation is also a viable mode. To develop greenery in many dry areas, Government is encouraging people to go in for tree plantations.</p>

        <p><span class="first-character atw">W</span><b>ATER CONFLICTS</b>

            Water conflict is a conflict between countries, states, or groups over the rights to access water resources. It can occur on both intrastate and interstate levels, and can be caused by territorial disputes, a fight for resources, and strategic advantage. Conflicts occur mostly over freshwater, which is a vital, yet unevenly distributed natural resource. There is a growing number of water conflicts that go unresolved, largely at the sub-national level, and these will become more dangerous as water becomes more scarce, climate changes alter local hydrology, and global population increases. Strategies to reduce the risks of such disputes are available, such as local and international laws and agreements, improved technology and institutions, and improved water availability and water sharing in water-scarce regions.<BR>
            
            <B>CAUSES:</B>
            
            Water scarcity has led to conflicts at local and regional levels due to the demand for water resources and potable water, control over access and allocation of water, and weak or missing water management institutions. Violence between pastoralists and farmers in sub-Saharan Africa is on the rise, and water scarcity can exacerbate conflicts and political tensions. Climate change and the growing global populations also increase the risk of water conflict.<BR>
            
            <B>PREDICTIONS</B>
            
            
            Over the past 25 years, politicians, academics and journalists have expressed concern that disputes over water would be a source of future wars. The water wars hypothesis is based on research on transboundary rivers such as the Indus, Jordan and Nile, which have experienced water-related disputes. Additionally, growing competition for water in water-scarce regions is raising the risks of water conflicts. Water resources that span international boundaries are more likely to be a source of collaboration and cooperation than war, as evidenced by the hundreds of treaties in place guiding equitable water use.<BR>
